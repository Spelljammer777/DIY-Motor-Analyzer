== DIY Wind Turbine Analyzer
The DIY Wind Turbine Analyzer will predict and graph the electrical power output of any horizontal-axis wind turbine under 20ft in blade diameter. It works on several inputs such as blade size, battery bank or AC voltage(for grid tie), length of power cabling, motor/generator's specs (current, voltage, and rpm), etc.
